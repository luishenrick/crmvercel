- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Database**: [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- **ORM**: [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- **Payments**: [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Running Locally

[Install](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli) and log in to your Stripe account:

```bash
stripe login
```

Use the included setup script to create your `.env` file:

```bash
pnpm db:setup
```

Run the database migrations and seed the database with a default user and team:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
```

This will create the following user and team:

- User: `test@test.com`
- Password: `admin123`

You can also create new users through the `/sign-up` route.

Finally, run the Next.js development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action.

You can listen for Stripe webhooks locally through their CLI to handle subscription change events:

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
```
